## The weather app
This app uses async web requests to get your data and show it to you via the browser. 
It will provide the simplest of UI so that you don't get confused... 

### Getting started
Initially the app runs @ the terminal, but the final version will come with a nice url and everything. 
So what you need to do is simply type in your address at the field provided and see the
forecast for it.

Example input: Sofia
<br>
Please do note that only the top result of the search is returned, so if you see something
weird or mismatching, then you may need to change the search to something more precise,
for example: Sofia, Bulgaria.
